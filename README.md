In the field of Alzheimer's disease detection, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool due to their adeptness in image processing tasks. However, the persistent issue of "Vanishing and Exploding gradients" within CNNs has led to the incorporation of costly techniques like Batch Normalization, which can hamper spatial and temporal efficiency. This research endeavors to address this challenge by introducing an innovative method of integrating normalization directly within the network architecture with minimal computational overhead. By leveraging the inherent orthonormal properties of unitary matrices, we demonstrate their suitability for data normalization when utilized as weight matrices in Neural Networks. Our approach involves generating orthogonal matrices through Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) during the initialization phase, coupled with an orthogonal regularization function to preserve matrix orthogonality. Notably, our findings establish that the inclusion of batch normalization becomes unnecessary when employing our proposed methodology. The study entailed the development of seven distinct CNN models, each with a specific configuration to ascertain the impact of orthogonal matrices and regularization. These models were rigorously evaluated using MRI single-frame images to classify individuals with Alzheimer's disease and cognitively normal cases. Although the test accuracies across all models were comparable, the results unveiled the significant advantages of the orthogonal model over the batch normalization and combined models. Specifically, the orthogonal model exhibited a noteworthy 6.09% improvement in training time and an impressive 8.4% reduction in memory consumption compared to the batch normalization model. Furthermore, it outperformed the combined model by 10.7% in time efficiency and 6.4% in memory utilization. The experiments were conducted in two phases, with the second phase confirming the robustness of the proposed methodology on an extensive dataset, validating the theoretical underpinnings established in the initial phase. This research underscores the effectiveness of integrating unitary matrices within CNN architectures, offering a promising avenue for enhancing the efficiency of Alzheimer's disease detection without compromising computational resources.
